I'm a Junior Software Engineer and what I specialize is front-end development in creating user friendly well-functioning dynamic websites that allows users to comfortably access and manipulate the website to their needs. 

I earned my technical skills through Bloomtech where they assisted me and provided all the resources I needed to confidently work in a team and build projects on a monthly basis. 

I truly believe in nourishing and developing the mind, body and soul so when Iâ€™m not coding, I like to be proactive and participate in group activities such as soccer, volleyball, basketball, spike-ball, improv, and salsa dancing.
